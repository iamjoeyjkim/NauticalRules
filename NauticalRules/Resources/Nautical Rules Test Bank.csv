If unmanned, only the last vessel in the tow must sound the signal (4 short blasts) if manned. However, Rule 35(g)(ii) specifically states that when a manned vessel is being towed, the signal prescribed in Rule 35(g)(i) shall be sounded by an interval of not more than 2 minutes by the last vessel of the tow, if manned.

The correct choice B, ""the last vessel in the tow and it is carrying a crew,"" is a simplification of Rule 35(g)(ii). The full rule is complex, but this option reflects the requirement for the last vessel in a tow to sound a signal if it is manned. However, the rule generally states a manned vessel being towed sounds 4 short blasts every 2 minutes. The question may be simplified for test purposes.

The correct answer (B) is derived from COLREG Rule 35(g)(ii). When in restricted visibility, the last vessel of a tow, if manned, shall sound a fog signal of four short blasts at intervals of not more than 2 minutes. The question's option B aligns with this requirement.
